      "**Deposits Into Your Leave Account:**\n",
      "- Vacation is calculated according to the employee's work anniversary year, calendar year, or fiscal year.\n",
      "- Employees receive vacation based on their length of service, which may be granted in a lump sum or accrued according to a schedule determined by the Company.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Leave Usage and Requests for Leave:**\n",
      "- Employees are encouraged to use their vacation time and must request it from their Manager as far in advance as possible.\n",
      "- The Company will generally grant requests for vacation when possible, considering business needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Carryover:**\n",

      "1. **At-Will Employment**: Employment with Zania, Inc. is on an \"at-will\" basis, meaning either the employee or the company can terminate the employment at any time, with or without notice and with or without cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **No Contract Creation**: Nothing in the employee handbook or any other company document is intended to create a contract for guaranteed or continued employment. Only the CEO has the authority to make promises regarding guaranteed employment, and such promises must be in writing and signed by the CEO.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Job Abandonment**: If an employee fails to show up for work or fails to call in with an acceptable reason for the absence for a specified period of consecutive days, they will be considered to have abandoned their job and voluntarily resigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Resignation Policy**: Employees are requested to provide a minimum of two weeks' notice of their resignation. Managers are requested to provide a minimum of four weeks' notice. Failure to provide the requested notice may result in ineligibility for rehire.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Final Pay**: Separated employees will be paid in accordance with applicable laws and company policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Return of Company Property**: Employees must return all company property at the time of separation. Failure to return property may result in deductions from the final paycheck where allowed by law.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Exit Interview**: Employees may be asked to participate in an exit interview when leaving the company, which aims to provide management with insights into the employee's decision to leave and identify areas for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the termination policy emphasizes the at-will nature of employment, the importance of notice for resignations, and the return of company property upon separation.\n",
